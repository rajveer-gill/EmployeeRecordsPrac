# Employee Records

## Description
I built this project to improve my skills on reading and outputting to files. The Files helps store and sort employee information. This project taught me more about file interaction within C and the use of binary data with files.

## Features
This project is able to read data from foreign files. It is also able to convert data to binary and output that data to other files. The project can also read binary data from foreign files. Finally, the project can output data to files that are not in binary form.

## How to use
In order to use the code for this project, download the zip file and open it. From there, upload the project and its contents to your local compiler. You can find a large variety of C compilers online to use.

## Technologies 
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaboraters
I was able to accomplish this with the assistance of Pearson's Starting out with C++ sixth edition lab manual.
